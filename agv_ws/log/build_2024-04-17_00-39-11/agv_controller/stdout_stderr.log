[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:14 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findcan.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "can", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "can" with any of
  the following names:

    canConfig.cmake
    can-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "can" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "can_DIR"
  to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "can" provides a
  separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
